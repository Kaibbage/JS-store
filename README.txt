Decisions made:
- tried to stick to what the base code was doing and add on to it
- Followed the specifications as closely as I could
- used pug for template engine
- tried to take and send all data through the server


How to run my server:
1. Navigate to where you saved my submission file in your file system
2. type in "npm install pug"
3. type in "node server.js"
4. Type in http://localhost:3000/ and you're good to go!
